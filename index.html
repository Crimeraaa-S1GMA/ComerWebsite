            <h2>Inspired by titles like Super Mario Bros and many other platformer games, <b>Comer</b> takes you through a journey to discover the secrets of the sewers which you had accidentally ended up in after returning home from a long day of work.</h2>
            <h2>Along the way, you will also find many dangers that await you, such as nasty enemies, deep black pits, even more nasty spikes, and much more.</h2>
            <h2>This game was made almost entirely by 1 person, crimeraaa, except for the soundtrack by Quabanos.</h2>

            <h2>(Not really) Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Q:</b> When is this game released?
                <br>
                <b>A:</b> Comer is intended to be released before the 1st of July.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Q:</b> How many levels are there?

                <b>A:</b> The game has 20 planned main levels, alongside that a few secret ones and a bonus one.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Q:</b> How much will it cost?
                <br>

            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Q:</b> Why is this game's story taking place in the sewers?
                <br>
                <b>A:</b> I had the very stupid idea of doing that when I was first planning out this game, and decided to go with the theme for the sake of it. I understand that not everyone might particularly like that this happened, but there are other platformer games you can play if you hate this idea that much.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Q:</b> What platforms will Comer support?
                <br>
                <b>A:</b> Comer currently supports all mainstream desktop platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux), Android and also has a HTML5 version.
